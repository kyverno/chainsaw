Opening multiple channels to ask the same question or report the same issue across different forums hinders our ability to manage and address community concerns effectively. This approach is vital for efficient time management, as duplicated questions can consume the time of multiple team members simultaneously.

This warning serves as a formal notice that their behavior is not in alignment with our community standards and Code of Conduct. The first warning is permanent.</p> <p>1.2. Second warning and opportunity for resolution: If the behavior persists, a second warning will be issued. Upon receiving the second warning, the user will be given a 5-day period for reflection, during which they are encouraged to publicly explain or apologize for their actions. This period is designed to offer an opportunity for openly clearing out any misunderstanding.</p> <p>1.3. Blocking: Should there be no response or improvement in behavior following the second warning, we reserve the right to block the user from the community and repository. Blocking is considered a last resort, used only when absolutely necessary to protect the community's integrity and positive atmosphere.</p> <p>Blocking has been an exceptionally rare necessity in our overwhelmingly positive community, highlighting our preference for constructive dialogue and mutual respect.
