## Overview

Chainsaw provides a declarative approach to test [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) operators and controllers.

While Chainsaw is designed for testing operators and controllers, it can declaratively test any Kubernetes objects.

Chainsaw is an open-source tool that was initially developed for defining and running [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) end-to-end tests.
