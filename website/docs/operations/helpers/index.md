# Kubectl helpers

Kubectl helpers are declarative versions of `kubectl` imperative commands.

## Implementation

Helpers are implemented as syntactic sugars.

They are translated into their corresponding `kubectl` [commands](../command.md) and executed as such.

### KUBECONFIG

- Chainsaw always executes commands in the context of a temporary `KUBECONFIG`, built from the configured target cluster.
- This specific `KUBECONFIG` has a single cluster, auth info and context configured (all named `chainsaw`).
