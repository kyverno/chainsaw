# cleanup

A `cleanup` statement is similar to a [finally](./finally.md) statement but will execute after the test finishes executing, while `finally` executes after the step finishes executing.

!!! tip
    All operations of a `cleanup` statement will be executed regardless of the success or failure of each of them.

## Operations
