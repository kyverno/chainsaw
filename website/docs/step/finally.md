# Finally

A `finally` statement is similar to a [catch](./catch.md) statement but will always execute after the [try](./try.md) and eventual [catch](./catch.md) statements finished executing regardless of the success or failure of the test step.

!!! tip
    All operations of a `finally` statement will be executed regardless of the success or failure of each of them.

## Operations

A `finally` statement supports only the following [operations](../operations/index.md):

- [Command](../operations/command.md)
- [Delete](../operations/delete.md)
