# finally

A `finally` statement is similar to a [catch](./catch.md) statement but will always execute after the [try](./try.md) and eventual [catch](./catch.md) statements finished executing regardless of the success or failure of the test step.

!!! tip
    All operations of a `finally` statement will be executed regardless of the success or failure of each of them.

## Operations
