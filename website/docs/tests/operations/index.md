# Operations

While tests are made of test steps, test steps can be considered made of operations.

Every operation in a test steps runs sequentially.

!!! warning "Only one action per operation"

    Every operation consists of a single action. While it is syntactically possible to create an operation with multiple actions, Chainsaw will verify and reject tests if operations containing multiple actions are found.

    The reasoning behind this intentional choice is that it becomes harder to understand in which order actions will be executed in case an operation consists of multiple actions. For this reason operations consisting of multiple actions are disallowed.

### Common fields

All operations share some configuration fields.

- **Timeout:** A timeout for the operation.
- **ContinueOnError:** Determines whether a test step should continue or not in case the operation was not successful.
  Even if the test continues executing, it will still be reported as failed.

!!! tip "Reference documentation"
    The full structure of the `Operation` is documented [here](../../apis/chainsaw.v1alpha1.md#chainsaw-kyverno-io-v1alpha1-Operation).

## Available operations

- [Delete](./delete.md)
- [Apply](./apply.md)
- [Create](./create.md)
- [Assert](./assert.md)
- [Error](./error.md)
- [Command](./command.md)
- [Script](./script.md)

## Operation checks

Some operations support checking the operation execution result against specific expectations.

See [Operation checks](./check.md) for use case details and supported operations.
