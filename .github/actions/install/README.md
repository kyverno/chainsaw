This action enables you to install Chainsaw.

# Usage

This action currently supports GitHub-provided Linux, macOS and Windows runners (self-hosted runners may not work).

Add the following entry to your Github workflow YAML file:

```yaml
uses: kyverno/chainsaw/.github/actions/install@v0.0.3
with:
  release: 'v0.0.3' # optional
```

Example using a pinned version:

```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions: {}

    name: Install Chainsaw
    steps:
      - name: Install Chainsaw
        uses: kyverno/chainsaw/.github/actions/install@v0.0.3
        with:
          release: 'v1.9.5'
      - name: Check install
        run: chainsaw version
```

Example using the default version:

```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions: {}

    name: Install Chainsaw
    steps:
      - name: Install Chainsaw
        uses: kyverno/chainsaw/.github/actions/install@v0.0.3
      - name: Check install
        run: chainsaw version
```

Example using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) verification:

```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions: {}

    name: Install Chainsaw
    steps:
      - name: Install Cosign
        uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.1.1
      - name: Install Chainsaw
        uses: kyverno/chainsaw/.github/actions/install@v0.0.3
        with:
          verify: true
      - name: Check install
        run: chainsaw version
```

If you want to install Chainsaw from its main version by using `go install` under the hood, you can set `release` as `main`.
Once you did that, Chainsaw will be installed via `go install` which means that please ensure that go is installed.

Example of installing Chainsaw via `go install`:

```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions: {}

    name: Install Chainsaw via go install
    steps:
      - name: Install go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.20'
          check-latest: true
      - name: Install Chainsaw
        uses: kyverno/chainsaw/.github/actions/install@v0.0.3
        with:
          release: main
      - name: Check install
        run: chainsaw version
```
